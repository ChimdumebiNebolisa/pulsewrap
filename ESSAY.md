# PulseWrap - Project Essay

## Background

TODO: Describe the background and motivation for creating PulseWrap. What problem does it solve? What inspired this project?

## Idea & Purpose

TODO: Explain the core idea behind PulseWrap. What makes it unique? What is its primary purpose and target use case?

## Tech Used

### Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)

TODO: Discuss why KMP was chosen. What benefits does it provide? How does it enable code sharing between Android and Desktop?

### Compose Multiplatform

TODO: Explain the choice of Compose Multiplatform for UI. How does it enable shared UI code? What are the advantages over platform-specific UI frameworks?

### kotlinx.serialization

TODO: Describe the use of kotlinx.serialization for JSON parsing. Why was this chosen over other serialization libraries?

### kotlinx.datetime

TODO: Explain the use of kotlinx.datetime for date handling. How does it help with cross-platform date operations?

## How It Works

TODO: Provide a detailed explanation of how PulseWrap works:

1. **Data Loading**: How datasets are loaded on different platforms using expect/actual
2. **Insight Calculation**: How the engine computes insights from raw data
3. **UI Flow**: How navigation and state management work
4. **Platform-Specific Features**: How sharing/export differs between platforms

## What I'd Improve Next

TODO: List potential improvements and future enhancements:

- Performance optimizations
- Additional insights or calculations
- UI/UX improvements
- Testing coverage
- Additional platforms (iOS, Web)
- Data visualization features
- Custom dataset import
